## Footer Support <MyBadge text="Apply Partically Support" />

The `footer` field can be configured in the `frontmatter` of the page.

The `footer` field accepts a string and also accepts a htmlString that will be rendered directly in the footer.

::: tip Other support
You can set `footer` to `true` to display the default footer. The default footer text is configured in the `themeConfig.footer` field.

At the same time, `footer` also accepts an object, using the `text` and `link` fields to quickly set a footer link.

::: details Example

```md
> Apply Default footer text
---
footer: true
---

> DIY footer text
---
footer: This website is served by Github Pages
---

> Quickly define a footer link
---
footer:
  text: Mr.Hope
  link: https://github.com/Mister-Hope
---

> Diy footer
---
footer: <a href="https://github.com/Mister-Hope">Mr.Hope</a>
---
```

When you set `footer.displayDefault` to true in the theme, you can also disable it locally

```md
---
footer: false
---
```
