# TS support

Most files of vuepress-theme-hope are written in Typescript, so vuepress-theme-hope also brings native Typescript support to your vuepress project.

This means you can use `enhanceAppFiles.ts` and use Tyepscript in both your vue components and Markdown files.

After enabling this theme, you no longer need to require and enable `@vuepress/plugin-typescript`.
