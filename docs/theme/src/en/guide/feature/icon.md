# Icon support

FontClass format icon support has been added in multiple places throughout the theme.

Please import the corresponding icon css file in `index.styl` under `.vuepress/styles`. E.g:

```css
@import '//at.alicdn.com/t/font_1446717_giwlq66d28j.css'
```

The prefix of the icon is `icon-` by default, which can be changed in the `iconPrefix` field in the theme configuration.
