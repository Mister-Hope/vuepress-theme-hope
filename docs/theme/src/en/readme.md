## Use themes

You can use [vuepress-theme-hope template](https://github.com/Mister-Hope/vuepress-theme-hope-template) directly to start your vuepress journey.

### Install

```bash
npm i -D vuepress-theme-hope
```

### Usage

```js
// .vuepress/config.js
const resolve = require("vuepress-theme-hope/resolve");

module.exports = resolve({
  // your config here
});
```

::: tip
The purpose of introducing the resolve function is to give you full hints through TS's Interface and JSDoc when you edit the configuration.

At the same time, the resolve function will also complete some default configurations for your current configuration which will pass directly to vuepress.

### FAQ

If you do not have typescript package in your project, you may also need to install it:

```bash
npm i -D typescript
```

And then create a `tsconfig.json` file in your root directory:

```json
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "target": "ES6", /// Any target which is not less than 'ES5'
    "allowSyntheticDefaultImports": true, // Avoiding some issues related to vuepress-types
    "experimentalDecorators": true, // Typescript files for '.vue' needs this option
    "module": "commonjs", // Avoiding some issues related to vuepress-types
    // type definition files of vuepress and this theme
    "types": ["@mr-hope/vuepress-theme-types", "@mr-hope/vuepress-types"]
  },
  "include": [
    "src/.vuepress/enhanceApp.ts" // replace `src` with your doc folder
  ]
}
```

If Typescript related errors appears in the conosle, that means Typescript is not correctly configured in your project.
