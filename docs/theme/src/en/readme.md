## Use themes

You can use [vuepress-theme-hope template](https://github.com/Mister-Hope/vuepress-theme-hope-template) directly to start your vuepress journey.

### Install

```bash
npm i -D vuepress-theme-hope
```

### Usage

```js
// .vuepress/config.js
const resolve = require('vuepress-theme-hope/resolve');

module.exports = resolve({
  // your config here
});
```

::: tip
The purpose of introducing the resolve function is to give you full hints through TS's Interface and JSDoc when you edit the configuration.

At the same time, the resolve function will also complete some default configurations for your current configuration items when you preview or package the project, reducing the calculation pressure when rendering the website.

### FAQ

If your project does not use typescript, you may also need to install typescript:

```bash
npm i -D typescript
```

And create a `tsconfig.json` file in your root directory

```json
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "target": "es5", // Any target except 'es3'
    "experimentalDecorators": true,
    "types": [
      "@mr-hope/vuepress-theme-types"
    ]
  },
  "include": [
    "src/.vuepress/enhanceApp.ts" // replace `src` with your doc folder
  ]
}
```

If Typescript related errors appears in the conosle, that means Typescript is not correctly configured in your project.
