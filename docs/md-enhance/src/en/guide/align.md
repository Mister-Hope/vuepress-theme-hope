# Align

## Configuration

```js {6}
module.exports = {
  plugin: [
    "md-enhance",
    {
      // Enable Align
      align: true,
    },
  ],
};
```

## Syntax

By injecting some options to `vuepress-plugin-container`, you can use

    ::: center
    Paragraph to be align-center
    :::

    ::: right
    Paragraph to be align-right
    :::

to diy your paragraph align.

If you need nesting, the outer `:::` needs to be increased in order.

```md
:::: right
Right-aligned text

Right-aligned text

::: center
Centered text
:::

Right-aligned text

::::
```
